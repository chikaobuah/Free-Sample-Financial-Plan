# Free-Sample-Financial-Plan
A few years ago when I ventured into entrepreneurship, I found building a statement of financial position really daunting. But we don’t know the future, and it’s always a good thing to have specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timebound goals. So I eventually created one for a startup I was building called The Making Academy.

Our goal was to promote the culture of making and innovation in Nigeria, through creative learning and networking. We sought to connect individuals with interest in technology and equip them with the skills to make great products and develop great ideas. We planned to monetize this dream through a carefully selected blend of courses that led to certification, a membership program that gave hands-on experience and connected people, as well as sales and support of the latest technology (3D printers,Drones, modular electronic kits and robotics equipment). We also had a very strong and tested team, many of which were instructors in the last General Electric Garages program, and are renowned industry experts.

In the end, it failed. But it’s failure has help me grow into a better entrepreneur.
